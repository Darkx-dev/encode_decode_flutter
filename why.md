# 💀 Why the hell the APK signing fix worked 

## 🧠 Short answer before you fall asleep

Shit worked because we **didn’t compress stuff that wasn’t supposed to be compressed**, mainly `.so` files (those native libs). Android’s picky as hell about it.

## 📦 Toolbox Analogy 

So imagine your APK is a toolbox.

- Normal files (images, layouts, whatever) are like random tools packed in Ziploc bags → they’re **compressed**.
- But some files, like `.so` native libraries, are like super-important wrenches stuck directly into foam slots — **not bagged**, just chillin’.

Now Android is this nosy quality inspector.

- If you take that toolbox and just **throw every tool into bags**, even the foam ones?
- Android’s like: “yo wtf is this? can’t install this garbage.” ❌

## 🤡 OURRR!!! Old Code F-#ed Up Like This:

- It just blindly threw **everything into Ziplocs**.
- Even the `.so` files that were meant to be left alone.
- Android saw the foam slot was empty and went **nah, this ain't legit**.

---

## ✅ New Code 

Now our new code is like:

> “Hmm, was this file originally in a bag or chillin’ free?”

- If it was bagged → bag it again.
- If it was foam slotted → don’t you DARE bag that thing.

Android’s like: ✅ “aight, this I can vibe with.”

## 🔍 Techy Bits, but Not Too Much

Some files need to be **uncompressed**. Mainly:
- Native `.so` libs
- Some random big asset files too sometimes

Why? Android wants to **mmap** them → it basically memory-loads them directly to save time and not waste RAM.  
If it’s compressed? Boom. Install = fail.

So the golden line in your code was:

```kotlin
newEntry.method = entry.method
```

And for uncompressed ones, you **had** to do:

```kotlin
if (newEntry.method == ZipEntry.STORED) {
    newEntry.size = entry.size
    newEntry.crc = entry.crc
}
```

Without that `size` and `crc` shit, ZIP format throws tantrums.

## 🧱 Pseudocode: Not Clean, But Understandable

```kotlin
for each file in original APK:
  if it’s not being replaced:
    create newEntry
    newEntry.method = entry.method  // copy compression state
    if it's uncompressed:
      copy size and crc too
    write it

for each new or updated file:
  just write it normally (compression is fine)

done. zip it. sign it. install it. vibe.
```

## TL;DR

**Don’t compress what ain’t meant to be compressed. Android gets mad. Your APK gets kicked out. Respect the foam slots.**
